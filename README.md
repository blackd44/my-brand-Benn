# My Personal Website
This is `pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript` project for my personal brand web, no frameworks, no libraries and no bootstrap

### Online output find it [here](https://mybrandbenn.vercel.app/)

### Running locally
If you clone this project first make sure that you have the local server for running this.

for me I used vscode extention called [`Live Server`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) but if you cave others that can run it No problem with it.

## Inside my brand
### Pages
you will find some pages in the header which are `Home`, `portifolio`, `blogs`, `about`, `contact`, `signin or signup` in each page with its content

in some pages there is the `dynamic contents`, that because of JavaScript

in this project [JavaScript](https://github.com/blackd44/my-brand-Benn/tree/main/js) stores its data in the [localstorage](https://javascript.info/localstorage) in other to be able to get them in future (like DataBase)
